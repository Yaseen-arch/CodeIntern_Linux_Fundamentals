Linux Fundamentals Internship

This repository contains my work for the Linux Fundamentals Internship by CodeIntern.
The tasks were completed on a Linux system as part of hands-on practice.

I worked on basic Linux commands, file and directory management, user and permission handling, and a simple shell script for automation. Each task includes screenshots and files to show the execution and results.

Tasks Completed

Task 1: Basic Linux commands and system information

Task 2: Users, groups, file permissions, and ownership

Task 3: Bash script to create automated backups
